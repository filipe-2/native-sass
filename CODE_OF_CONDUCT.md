# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, the contributors and maintainers of this project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of our community. We value respectful communication and constructive collaboration.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, race, religion, or any other personal characteristic
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing private information without consent
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior. Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may be removed from the project team.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by this project, including but not limited to:

- GitHub issues and pull requests
- Project-related chat channels (e.g., Slack, Discord)
- Project-related events (e.g., meetups, conferences)
- In-person and virtual discussions related to the project

This Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when the individual is representing the project or its community (e.g., on Twitter, blog posts, or public forums).

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these steps in response to Code of Conduct violations:

1. **Immediate response**: If the behavior is deemed to be disruptive, a maintainer may take immediate action (e.g., removing offending content or issuing a temporary suspension).
2. **Investigation**: The maintainer will investigate the incident, gather all relevant information, and determine whether further action is needed.
3. **Resolution**: If a violation is found, the maintainer will discuss the appropriate course of action with the involved parties. This could include issuing a warning, revoking access, or other measures.
4. **Escalation**: If the situation is not resolved, further steps will be taken, including possible temporary or permanent removal from the community.
